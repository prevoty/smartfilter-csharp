# SmartFilter C# bindings

## SmartFilter

The SmartFilter REST API is the easiest way for individuals and organizations to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in their web applications. The API has been designed to provide simple access to the powerful content analysis systems and intelligence tools that Prevoty has developed.

## C# bindings

Prevoty has developed a C# library to use SmartFilter quickly and easily. Note, this library was built with Mono on OS X. There may be some quirks trying to use this on Windows. Pull requests are appreciated.
